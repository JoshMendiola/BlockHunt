# BlockHunt
A Minecraft minigame, compatible with versions 1.16+ , where players are given 5 minutes to find and jump on a randomly chosen block. If the timer runs out, players who failed to find their block within the time frame are immediately killed and ejected from the game. Last person standing wins

This minigame is fun, and can be very intense and high energy, and involes just a few commands to operate everything succesfully and quickly. 
Remember that in order to play, a player has to register as a blockhunter first, and is immediately stripped of thier blockhunter title once they fail to find their block in time

## usage
this plugin comes with 3 seperate commands

establishes the command sender as a blockhunter
```bash
/beblockhunter
```
allows the command sender to leave blockhunt if they no longer wish to play
```bash
/leaveblockhunt
```
begins the game
```bash
/startsblockhunt
```
